### HOW TO RUN
Download a binary for your operating system from the releases page.
You will need to add it to your PATH to easily run it. The 
run command is `re-view`. You can also pass a pre-formed regex as an 
argument to the executable - ex: `re-view "[tf]oo"`

Prerequisites: `cmake`, `make`
```bash
cmake -S . -B build/ && cmake --build build/
./build/src/foo
```
Add the `-DRUN-TESTS=OFF` flag to cmake to disable the tests being included.

To run unit tests, simply run `ctest` in the `build/`directory.
